# Cricket07Automation

This is a small project to automate Cricket 07! 

## How does the code work?

We first need to extract only the pitch using OpenCV.

We can then check for the place where the ball is gonna land which is indicated by the "blue circle".

We can the train a neural network for different ball positions. 

Once that's done, enjoy watching your PC play 100x times better than you!
